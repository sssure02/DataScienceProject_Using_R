    "<p> Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. \n",

    "these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data. \n",

We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily basis and then extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information.

    "#### Improvements\n",
    "- A deeper EDA can be performed by exploring the relationships between the predictors rather than just looking at predictor's relationship with the response variable.\n",
    "- More models such as GARCH and weighted least squares can be built instead of multiple linear regression to account for non-constant variance of the error terms.\n",
