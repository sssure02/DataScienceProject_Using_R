# âœ¨Predicting Bike Rental Demand 

### Project Overview
I am excited to share my first data science project, where I focused on predicting bike rental demand using the bike-sharing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Key Achievements
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted a thorough EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the dataset.
#### Model Training: Trained five different models:
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Generalized Least Squares (GLS)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Random Forest
* Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
####  Model Evaluation: Evaluated and compared the test RMSE of all models, discovering that KNN provided the most accurate predictions.
