# Predicting Bike Rental Demand [My First Data Science Project]

#### In this project, I was able to
- Perform EDA using the bike-sharing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- Train five models (multiple linear regression, generalized least squares, KNN, Random Forest, GAM) using this dataset.
- Find out that KNN provides better predictions.
